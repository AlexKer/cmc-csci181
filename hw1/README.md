# Intro to pytorch

**Due:** Tuesday, 28 Jan at midnight

## Tasks

You are required to complete the following tasks:

1. Install pytorch
1. Modify the `rosenbrock.py` file so that it calculates the minimum of the rosenbrock function
1. Upload your completed code to Sakai

### Optional

You are not required to complete the following tasks,
however they are good exercises to get you familiar with pytorch.

1. Modify the `rosenbrock` function so that instead of taking two scalar variables as input, it takes a 2-dimensional vector as input.
   You will also have to update the optimization code to handle the new type of input.

1. Extend the `rosenbrock` function to arbitrary dimensions using wikipedia's high-dimensional rosenbrock function: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function

## Submission

Upload your `rosenbrock.py` file to sakai
