# CNNs

**Due:** Thursday, 13 February at midnight

## Tasks

You are required to complete the following tasks:

1. Use PyTorch's neural networks tutorial [part 1](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/neural_networks_tutorial.html) and [part 2](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) to create a python script that trains a small CNN on the CIFAR10 dataset
1. Modify the code to work on the Fashion-MNIST dataset as well
1. Modify the data input pipeline to include data augmentation using the `torchsample` library.  See [this github repo](https://github.com/jiangqy/Data-Augmentation-Pytorch) for example code.

### Optional

You are not required to complete the following tasks,
however they are good exercises to get you familiar with pytorch.

1. Structure your python file so that it uses argparse to store all hyperparameters.

1. Write a shell script that experiments with different hyperparameter combinations.

1. Make one of the optional hyperparameters the use of the Adam optimizer instead of SGD.
   See [this pytorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/examples_nn/two_layer_net_optim.html) for an example.
